# Damage-Report-Converter
A tool for converting damage reports for the CMSC from the format used by the control set Mercury to the format used by the control set Thorium

The Christa McAuliffe Space Center (CMSC) has used different control sets for starship simulations. 
One of these was known as Mercury, and had a specific format used for damage reports at the engineering station, 
using semicolons to separate steps. Later the CMSC began using a control set known as Thorium, which used a different
format for separating damage report steps Where each is marked by "Step <stepCount>:". 
This simple tool allows you to select reports in the Mercury format, and converts them to be usable in Thorium.
